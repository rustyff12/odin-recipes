    <!--- About --->
    <section id="odin" class="odin">
      <h2>About Odin the Allfather</h2>
      <p>
        As the Allfather of the Aesir, Odin is known for his wisdom and
        knowledge. But what many may not know is that he is also a masterful
        chef. Odin's culinary journey began in his youth, as he traveled the
        Nine Realms, seeking wisdom and knowledge. During his travels, he
        visited many realms, each with its unique culture, customs and of
        course, delicious food.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Odin explored each realm, he learned from the local chefs and cooks,
        studying their methods and techniques. He learned to cook with fire in
        the fiery realm of Muspelheim, and to create dishes that would sustain
        him during his long journeys in the cold realm of Niflheim. He even
        visited the realm of the giants, where he learned to cook with
        giant-sized ingredients and cookware.
      </p>
      <p>
        Odin's culinary skills continued to develop over centuries, and
        eventually became one of the best cook in the Nine Realms. He even
        became the chief cook and steward of Asgard. His dishes are not only
        delicious, but also packed with wisdom, knowledge and power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Odin shares his culinary knowledge with mortals such as yourself, in
        hopes that you will enjoy and learn from his recipes. So sharpen your
        knives and kindle your fires, for the feast is about to begin.
