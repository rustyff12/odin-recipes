            Roast beef doesn't refer to just one cut of beef — eye of round, bottom
            round roast, top round roast, top sirloin roast, and bone-in rib roast
            are all commonly used cuts. Affordable eye of round roast is the best
            pick for this recipe — its rich flavors develop beautifully during slow
            cooking.

          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="ingredients">
              3 pounds beef eye of round roast, at room temperature
            </li>
            <li class="ingredients">½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li class="ingredients">½ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste</li>
            <li class="ingredients">
              ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
            </li>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li class="steps">Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li class="steps">
              Make sure roast is at room temperature. Tie roast at 3-inch intervals
              with cotton twine; this helps it from drying out and allows it to cook
              more evenly. Place roast on a rack in a baking pan.
            </li>
            <li class="steps">
              Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub
              seasoning mixture into the meat.
            </li>
            <li class="steps">
              Place in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes
              per pound if your roast is larger or smaller. An instant-read
              thermometer inserted into the center should read 120 to 125 degrees F
              (49 to 52 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li class="steps">
              Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely
              with foil, and let rest so juices can redistribute, 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li class="steps">Slice and serve.</li>
