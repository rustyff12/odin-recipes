        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="steps">Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li class="steps">Make sure roast is at room temperature. Tie roast at 3-inch intervals with cotton twine; this helps it from drying out and allows it to cook more evenly. Place roast on a rack in a baking pan.</li>
            <li class="steps">Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub seasoning mixture into the meat.</li>
            <li class="steps">Place in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes per pound if your roast is larger or smaller. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C).</li>
            <li class="steps">Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil, and let rest so juices can redistribute, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li class="steps">Slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
